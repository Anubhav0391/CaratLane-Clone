### Routes

- **User routes:**

3. `PATCH /update/:id` : update a cart item
4. `DELETE /delete/:id` : delete a cart item by id

### Features

#### `GET /`

- `productID` gets populated by product data including fields like `_id`, `title`, `image`, `price`, `original_price`

#### `POST /`

- On adding a product, if the product already exists, the count of that product increments in the cart (upto a quantity limit), otherwise it gets added. The response looks like `{ data, message: "Product successfully added to cart" }`, where data is the cart item after updation.

2. **adminAuth**: Verifies the token in header to check whether admin is logged in. Applied on admin routes.

## End Notes :

Throughout this project, I aimed to create a near-perfect replica of the original website by meticulously implementing its features and functionalities. This constructive experience has not only helped me gain confidence, but has also imparted valuable lessons that I can apply in real-world scenarios. As a result, I have successfully integrated most of the website's features and functionalities into my project.
